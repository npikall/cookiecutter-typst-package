A short description about the project and/or client.

## Template adaptation checklist

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo uses Justfiles to run task/tools.
> You will need the following tools installed to run all the recipes:
>
> - [just] to run the `Justfile Recipes` themselfs
> - [tytanic] to setup and run tests on your code
> - [pre-commit] to run the pre-commit hooks (auto formatting your code and other useful things)

- [ ] Fill out `README.md`
  - Check section contents and/or delete sections that don't apply
- [ ] Check and/or replace `LICENSE` by something that suits your needs
- [ ] Fill out `typst.toml`. See also the [typst/packages README]
- [ ] Adapt Repository URLs in `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Consider only committing that file with your first release, or removing the "Initial Release" part in the beginning
- [ ] Adapt or deactivate the release workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - to deactivate it, delete that file or remove/comment out lines 2-4 (`on:` and following)
  - to use the workflow
    - [ ] check the values under `env:`, particularly `REGISTRY_REPO`
    - [ ] if you don't have one, create a [fine-grained personal access token] with [Contents permission] for the `REGISTRY_REPO`
    - [ ] on this repo, create a secret `REGISTRY_TOKEN` (at `https://github.com/[user]/[repo]/settings/secrets/actions`) that contains the so created token

    if configured correctly, whenever you create a tag `v...`, your package will be pushed onto a branch on the `REGISTRY_REPO`, from which you can then create a pull request against [typst/packages](https://github.com/typst/packages/)

- [ ] remove/replace the example test case
- [ ] (add your actual code, docs and tests)
- [ ] remove this section from the README

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on the typst web app. Perhaps a short code example on importing the package and a very simple teaser usage.

```typ
#import "@preview/{{cookiecutter.__project_slug}}:0.1.0": *

#show: my-show-rule.with()
#my-func()
```

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running. This should explain how to clone the repo and where to (maybe a link to the typst documentation on it), along with any pre-requisite software and installation steps.

```
$ First step
$ Another step
$ Final step
```

## Usage

A more in-depth description of usage. Any template arguments? A complicated example that showcases most if not all of the functions the package provides? This is also an excellent place to signpost the manual.

```typ
#import "@preview/{{cookiecutter.__project_slug}}:0.1.0": *

#let my-complicated-example = ...
```
